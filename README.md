# B-Critics Website Repo

## Code Types
There are four different types of files on here:
- Data
- Modules
- Pages
- Other

Data feeds into Modules and Pages.
Modules and Pages are the visual end-products. Modules can be embedded within a Google sites page (implication: Liz & Court can edit the page still), whereas Pages are literally the page (must be edited via code e.g. the Episode tiles).
Other category is reserved for weird shit because I don't know what I'm doing.<br/><br/>
### Data<br/>
**Data.json**<br/>The automatically updating list queried from Spotify and refreshed every day.

**Episode Covers**<br/>

### Modules<br/>

**Home pg: Social Media Links**<br/>The buttons for all socials and the two Spotify & Apple Podcast banners.
<br/>
<br/>
### Pages
